            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <img src="images/profile.jpeg" alt="Art Olivas">
            <p>Hey there! I'm Arturo Olivas, but you can just call me Artâ€”like the Mona Lisa, but with a bit more
                Tex-Mex flair. Born and bred in the bustling heart of Houston, TX, I've since traded the humidity for
                the sizzling heat of Phoenix, AZ. I've been living here for a while now, perfecting my cactus-watering
                techniques. I've been blissfully married for about 10 years to the love of my life, who is as amazing as
                a perfectly made enchilada. Together, we have two fantastic kidsâ€”a boy and a girlâ€”who keep us on our
                toes and our pantry stocked with snacks. </p>
            <p>When I'm not buried in lines of code, you can catch me with my headphones on, tuning into the latest
                podcast. I'm a podcast junkie, always on the hunt for the next great story or fascinating fact. And
                speaking of hunts, I'm perpetually on a quest for the best enchiladas around. Seriously, if you know a
                good place, I'm all ears!</p>
            <p>Life is a blend of family, coding, and a sprinkle of good humor. I'm always looking for new challenges
                and opportunities to grow, whether it's in the tech world or finding the perfect balance of cheese and
                sauce. So, that's me in a nutshellâ€”Art, the coding, podcast-loving, enchilada-eating guy from Houston
                now thriving in Phoenix.</p>

            <p>Madagascar is the 4th largest island in the world and is located in the Indian Ocean. It is home to 5% of
                the world's plant and animal species, of which more than 80% are endemic to Madagascar. The island is
                best known for its lemurs, baobab trees, and vanilla.</p>
