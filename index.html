            <img src="images/profile.jpeg" alt="Art Olivas">
            <p>Hey there! I'm Arturo Olivas, but you can just call me Art‚Äîlike the Mona Lisa, but with a bit more
                Tex-Mex flair. Born and bred in the bustling heart of Houston, TX, I've since traded the humidity for
                the sizzling heat of Phoenix, AZ. I've been living here for a while now, perfecting my cactus-watering
                techniques. I've been blissfully married for about 10 years to the love of my life, who is as amazing as
                a perfectly made enchilada. Together, we have two fantastic kids‚Äîa boy and a girl‚Äîwho keep us on our
                toes and our pantry stocked with snacks. </p>
            <p>When I'm not buried in lines of code, you can catch me with my headphones on, tuning into the latest
                podcast. I'm a podcast junkie, always on the hunt for the next great story or fascinating fact. And
                speaking of hunts, I'm perpetually on a quest for the best enchiladas around. Seriously, if you know a
                good place, I'm all ears!</p>
            <p>Life is a blend of family, coding, and a sprinkle of good humor. I'm always looking for new challenges
                and opportunities to grow, whether it's in the tech world or finding the perfect balance of cheese and
                sauce. So, that's me in a nutshell‚ÄîArt, the coding, podcast-loving, enchilada-eating guy from Houston
                now thriving in Phoenix.</p>

            <h2>Manhattan, New York</h2>
            <img src="images/timesquare.jpeg" alt="family picture in time square">
            <p>I absolutely love New York City! Having lived in Manhattan for a couple of years, I got to experience the city's vibrant pulse up close. The food scene is a culinary rollercoaster‚Äîevery meal is a new adventure, from bagels that could start a religious debate to pizza slices bigger than your face. The city's energy is electric, the diversity is like a global potluck, and the entertainment options are endless. Did I mention the food? Seriously, if there's one thing New York excels at, it's making you question if your pants still fit after all the culinary indulgence. New York City truly has a special place in my heart. ‚ô•Ô∏è</p>
