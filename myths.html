                <h2>Common Myths About Happiness</h2>
                <p>Professor Santos's course reveals that many of our intuitions about happiness are wrong. For instance, people often believe that material wealth, high achievements, or significant life changes will bring lasting happiness. However, research shows that these factors have minimal impact on long-term well-being.</p>
                <p>Santos introduces the concept of the "G.I. Joe Fallacy," which suggests that knowing what makes us happy is not enough to achieve happiness. Instead, we must actively practice behaviors that lead to happiness, such as gratitude, optimism, and physical activity.</p>
