                <h2>The Importance of Happiness</h2>
                <p>Professor Laurie Santos, who created the most popular course in the history of Yale University, emphasizes that understanding and practicing happiness is crucial for overall well-being. Despite being students at an Ivy League school, many are overwhelmed, stressed, anxious, and depressed.</p>
                <p>Santos's course, PSYC 157: Psychology and the Good Life, focuses on positive psychology, behavior change, and the practice of happiness. The goal is to teach students not just the science of happiness but also the practical steps to achieve it.</p>
